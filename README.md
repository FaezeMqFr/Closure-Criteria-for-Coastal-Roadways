# Closure Criteria for Coastal Roadways under Flooding Conditions  
### Vehicle Stability and Roadway Safety Dashboard

This interactive dashboard evaluates roadway safety during coastal flooding by analyzing vehicle stability as a function of **water depth** and **water velocity**. It visualizes hazard zones from hydrodynamic stability analyses and compares user-entered conditions against research-based safety criteria and vehicle-specific clearance thresholds.

This work is based on the following peer-reviewed study:

## Overview

Floodwaters can destabilize vehicles through loss of traction, buoyancy, and lateral hydraulic forces. Even shallow or moderate flows can lead to vehicle sweep or overturning. The dashboard provides a clear visual and quantitative reference to help support roadway closure decisions, emergency management planning, and public safety communication.

## Features

- Real-time plotting of **Water Depth (m)** vs. **Water Velocity (m/s)**.
- Color-coded hazard zones: **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, **Extreme**.
- Vehicle selection by category or specific model, applying clearance-based stability thresholds.
- Reference guideline overlays, including:
  - **AR&R Stability Criteria** (Small Car, Large Car, 4WD)
  - **Austroads (2008)** Floodway Safety Standards
  - **National Weather Service (NWS)** Vehicle Sweep Risk Guidelines
- Automated risk interpretation and status messaging.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Current Water Conditions**: Set *water depth (m)* and *velocity (m/s)*.
2. **Select Vehicle Type (Optional)**: Choose a general category or specific model to apply vehicle clearance and stability thresholds.
3. **Toggle Safety Guidelines**: Display or hide AR&R, Austroads, and NWS reference lines.
4. **Interpret the Result**:
   - The crosshair plots your current flood condition.
   - The background zone color indicates hazard level.
   - The safety message panel provides vehicle-specific interpretation.

## Safety Zone Interpretation

| Zone | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Low Hazard (Green)** | Conditions generally stable for most vehicles. | Proceed slowly with caution. |
| **Medium Hazard (Yellow)** | Elevated instability risk. | Avoid crossing unless essential and conditions are monitored. |
| **High Hazard (Orange)** | High likelihood of instability or loss of control. | Do not cross. |
| **Extreme Hazard (Red)** | Severe sweep/submersion risk. | **Turn around; do not enter floodwater.** |
